This is a zelda type game. This took me a little more than two months. 
To run it, run main.py. The controls are:
SPACE: ATTACK
ARROW KEYS: MOVE
P: PAUSE
B: BOMB
S: TOGGLE SWIMMING(SNORKEL)
C: SHOW EXIT
C AGAIN: TURN SHOW EXIT OFF


# PLEASE REMEMBER: NOTHING EXCEPT THE PIXEL ART AND CODE IS MINE!!! I DO *NOT* OWN THE RIGHTS TO THE MUSIC OR FONT! THIS GAME WAS INSPIRED BY ZELDA, A NITENDO FRANCHISE!
